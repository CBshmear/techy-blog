## Description

This repo contains all the code for a simple blog where users are able to make posts, and comment on other people's posts. As well as view a personal dashboard of their own posts where the user has the option to delete individual posts. This way, users are able to share knowledge and stay up to date on any number of web-dev topics. I ran into tremendous trouble trying to get the comment functionality to work. Through that struggle i learned lots about using sequelize and its associations.

## Installation
Run the command "NPM I" to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage
